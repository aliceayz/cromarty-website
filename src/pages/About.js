        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Sydney Lawn Tennis Club was incorporated by an Act of the Nova Scotia Legislature on 28 April 1893. The club was founded by Murray Dodd, Frederick C. Kimber, Edmund T. MacKeen, John A. Young, and David A. Hearn</p>
        <p>A few years later, the Sydney Lawn Tennis Club decided to purchase about an acre of land at Sherwood, part of the Dr. McLeod estate on Reservoir Brook in Sydney. They believed this would provide enough land to construct five tennis courts, a bowling green, handball courts, and quiet grounds. The price was to be about $2,500. On the evening of 24 April 1902, a meeting of subscribers to the Tennis Association were held at the offices of Burchell & McIntyre in Sydney. By June 1902 two courts had been completed and were in use every evening by the players. The remaining courts were to be completed as soon as the weather would permit.</p>
        <p>A formal opening of the Lawn Tennis grounds at Cromarty took place on Saturday afternoon, 19 July 1902 and was largely attended. The Sydney Lawn Tennis Club's Annual Tournament, held on the club's new grounds at Cromarty Street, commenced on 5 August 1902</p>
        <p>The following year, An Act to incorporate the Sydney Tennis Association, Limited was passed on the 11th day of April, A.D., 1903. Five members were named in the Act's introduction. That same year the third annual Nova Scotia Lawn Tennis Association Annual Tournament was held on the grounds of the Sydney Tennis Club.</p>
        <p>The first club house was built by 1905. The association transferred title of the property to the Kinsmen in 1958. The ownership of the property was transferred to the City of Sydney on 1 January 1963, and the club has since that time been operated by the Cromarty Tennis Club Society, and its predecessors.</p>

            Presently we continue to be located at 65 Cromarty St!
